        <ul style="color: darkblue;">
            <li>2 cups of cooked and cooled rice (day-old rice works best)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil (vegetable, canola, or sesame oil)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup mixed vegetables (such as carrots, peas, bell peppers, and corn)</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon oyster sauce (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Green onions or cilantro for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>

<div>        <h3 style="color: green;">Instructions:</h3>
        <ol style="color: darkblue;">
            <li>Prepare the Rice:
                <ul>
                    <li>Use cooked and cooled rice. If you're using freshly cooked rice, spread it out on a baking sheet and let it cool in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Cold rice ensures that the grains won't stick together when frying.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Heat the Pan:
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the cooking oil and let it heat up.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Sauté the Aromatics:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add minced garlic and chopped onions to the hot oil. Sauté for 1-2 minutes or until they become fragrant and the onions turn translucent.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Scramble the Eggs:
                <ul>
                    <li>Push the garlic and onions to one side of the pan, creating an empty space. Pour the beaten eggs into that space. Scramble the eggs until they are mostly set but still slightly runny.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add Vegetables:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the mixed vegetables to the pan and stir-fry for a few minutes until they are tender. You can use frozen vegetables, just make sure they are thawed and excess water is removed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add Rice:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the cold cooked rice to the pan. Break up any clumps and stir-fry with the vegetables, eggs, and aromatics. Continue cooking for 3-4 minutes, or until the rice is heated through and starts to turn slightly crispy.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Season the Rice:
                <ul>
                    <li>Drizzle the soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using) over the rice. Stir well to evenly distribute the sauces. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the seasoning according to your preferences.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Finish and Garnish:
                <ul>
                    <li>Once everything is well mixed and the rice is heated through, remove the pan from the heat. If desired, garnish with chopped green onions or cilantro for added flavor and color.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Serve:
                <ul>
                    <li>Serve your homemade fried rice hot as a main dish or side. You can also customize it with your favorite proteins, like cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: center;color: crimson;">Enjoy your delicious homemade fried rice! Feel free to get creative with the ingredients to make it your own.
